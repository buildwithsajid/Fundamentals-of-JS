# Fundamentals-of-JS
Hey there! 👋

I’m learning JavaScript on my own, and this repo is basically my playground and notebook.
I’ve been putting together all the things I’m practicing — from the basics to small projects — so I can come back and revise easily.

What’s in here

Variables (var, let, const)

Functions & scope stuff

Arrays, objects, loops, conditionals

Promises and async/await

DOM manipulation

A few mini-projects/examples

Everything has comments and small examples so it’s easy to understand. I wrote it more like “this is how I would explain it to myself” than a perfect tutorial.

How to use it

Just clone the repo, open the JS files or HTML files in your browser, and play around with the code. Try changing things, break stuff — that’s how I learn best 😄
